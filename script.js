//the timer, per research is a dom function. it will be activated whent the start button is pushed.
//im still playing with research to get the function right, but it should be in js not html. 
//I got it started for reference. :-)

const timer= document.getElementById("StartButton")
timer.addEventListener("click", () => {

})
